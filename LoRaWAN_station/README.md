Before using the RIOT client, download RIOT-OS (required), clone it into your workspace (e.g. IoTLab), copy the content of this folder under your RIOT folder typing the command below; if you intend to use it on your machine, follow the same procedure.


```
 cp -a IoT-VirtualEnvironmentSensor/LoRaWAN_station/. RIOT/tests/pkg_semtech-loramac
